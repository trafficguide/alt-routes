KML files are like XML files, and they should be readable by XML DOMs.

Meanwhile, KMZ files are basically WTF files: files that cannot be read without a WTF emotion.

So the generation procedure can be like this:

Stack A:
1. Obtain the list of bus stops
2. The bus stops all have their coordinates in the HK1980 standard. Convert all coordinates to WCS84 standard, which is used in GPS systems (and Google Map!)
3. Save the converted coordinates to somewhere safe.

Stack B:
1. There are many neighbourhoods in HK (I call them "hoods"). Map them out using Google Maps.
2. Export the map data into the KML format.
3. Generate "hood definitions" which contains the "hood bounding points"

Stack C:
1. Using the "Point in Polygon" algorithms available, map every bus stop from Stack A to a hood in Stack B. (In other words, contruct a function.)
2. Generate a "hoods traveled" list for each bus route using the mapping generated in Step 1. (In other words, construct a list of y = f(x) where f is the function defined in Step 1 and x is the bus stop of the bus route.)
3. Simplify the "hoods" list.
4. Together with other metadata, generate a full expression of Bus Line Definition in valid TypeScript syntax.
