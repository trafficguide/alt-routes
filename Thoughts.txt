Traditional method:
Input by hand

New method:
Generate by program

Trad-M Traits:
- Labor intensive
- Makes clear sense
- Can add interchange rules easily
- May be hard to calculate actual fare

New-M Traits:
- Inhomogeneous data source: minibus do not have unified database yet
- Automated and effort-free
- May be able to calculate actual fare (?)

Proposed temporary plan:
- Focus on minibuses; this seems lacking for the moment.

*** Interchange scheme
- Release interchange waypoint to merely a string, should help a bit.
