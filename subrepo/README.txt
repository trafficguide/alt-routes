In preparation of the "true expansion" of Pathfinder Project, several other Sub-Projects will be set up.

GeoConvertLib: a DLL library that will convert between the HK1980 (Grid) and WCS84 (GPS) geo-coordinate standards to convert bus stop positions to the more standard format (which is WCS84) using the online service at HK Geodectic Service through the Internet
GeoCoordsConverter: a program that wraps around the GeoConvertLib and conducts geo-coords conversion, encapsualating the HTTP-level operations.
